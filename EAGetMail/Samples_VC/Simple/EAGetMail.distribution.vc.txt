Manifest file:
    - Describes the names and versions of shared side-by-side assemblies that the application should 
      bind to at run time and may also contain metadata for private side-by-side assemblies used by the application.
      It helps to distribute EAGetMail ActiveX/COM object without regsvr32.exe.

VC++ 6.0, VS2003 and VS2005
  - VC++ 6.0, VS2003 and VS2005 don't support embedded manifest.
    Compile your  application to exe file and use external manifest (yourappname.exe.manifest) directly.

  - Copy EAGetMailObj.manifest or EAGetMailObj.XP.manifest to the same folder of .exe,
  
  - Rename .manifest file to yourapp.exe.manifest. For example, if your .exe is project1.exe,
    rename .manifest file to project1.exe.manifest
  
  - Copy Lib\native\x86\EAGetMailObj.dll (32bit) or  Lib\native\x64\EAGetMailObj.dll (64bit) to 
    the same folder of .exe, then it is ok.

    Files in your application folder: yourapp.exe, yourapp.exe.manifest, EAGetMailObj.dll

VS 2008 and later versions
  - VS 2008 and later version support embedded manifest.
  
  - Go to Project -> Your project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> 
    Manifest Tool -> Input and Output -> Aditional Manifest Files -> input: 
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\EAGetMail\Include\manifest\EAGetMailObj.manifest"

  - Compile your project, Visual Studio generates an embedded manifest file automatically, 
    external manifest file is not required. 

- Copy Lib\native\x86\EAGetMailObj.dll (32bit) or  Lib\native\x64\EAGetMailObj.dll (64bit) to 
    the same folder of .exe, then it is ok.

  Files in your application folder: yourapp.exe, EAGetMailObj.dll


Important Notice:

You must use __uuidof instead of COM ProgID in your source code.

// Correct
IMailPtr oMail = NULL;
oMail.CreateInstance(__uuidof(EAGetMailObjLib::Mail));

// Wrong
IMailPtr oSmtp = NULL;
oMail.CreateInstance("EAGetMailObj.Mail");

Notice: EAGetMail .NET Assembly doesn't require manifest file.
