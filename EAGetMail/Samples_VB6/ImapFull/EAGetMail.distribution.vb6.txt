Manifest file:
    - Describes the names and versions of shared side-by-side assemblies that the application should 
      bind to at run time and may also contain metadata for private side-by-side assemblies used by the application.
      It helps to distribute EAGetMail ActiveX/COM object without regsvr32.exe.

Installation folder\manifest
    - EAGetMailObj.manifest describes EAGetMailObj com class interface.

- VB6.0
  - Copy EAGetMailObj.manifest or EAGetMailObj.XP.manifest to the same folder of .exe,
  - Rename .manifest file to yourapp.exe.manifest. For example, if your .exe is project1.exe,
    rename .manifest file to project1.exe.manifest
  - Copy Lib\native\x86\EAGetMailObj.dll to the same folder of .exe, then it works fine.

    Files in your application folder: yourapp.exe, yourapp.exe.manifest, EAGetMailObj.dll


Note: EAGetMail .NET Assembly doesn't require manifest file.
